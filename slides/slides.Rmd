## Basic terminology: projects and spaces

--

A **project** is a fundamental unit of work.

--

A **space** is a place for a group of people to collaborate on work.

--

Spaces are great for classwork!

---
class: panel-narrow-slide
## Basic terminology: roles

--

**Admin**: can view, manage and edit all projects, manage space membership, and delete the space itself. 
**Good for: instructors.**

--

**Moderator**: can view, manage, and edit all projects in the space. 
**Good for: TAs.**

--

**Contributor**: see public projects in the space, and create new projects in the space. 
**Good for: students.**

--

**Viewer**: see public projects in the space. Cannot create new projects. 
**Good for: visitors.**

---
class: panel-narrow-slide
## Basic terminology: visibility

A project can be **public** or **private**.

--

Private projects in a space can be viewed by the author *and* space admins and moderators.

--

Private projects have a lock icon: <span class="lock">![lock icon](./images/iconPrivate.svg)</span>

## What else?

--

New project from a git repo: <span class="ridiculously-full-thumbnail inline-image">![new git project](./images/newProjectGit.png)</span>

--

Use a **base project** to include a default set of packages and files:
